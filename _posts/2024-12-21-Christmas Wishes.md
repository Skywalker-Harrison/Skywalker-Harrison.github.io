I’m Harrison, and I’m truly delighted to be here today. Let me begin by wishing you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! As we reflect on the past year, it’s clear that it has been a journey filled with laughter and tears, opportunities and challenges, joy and regret, excitement and pain, peace and conflict. Together, these experiences have become the invaluable building blocks of our lives.

I’d like to share a quote from the renowned American writer Bill Bryson:
“To my mind, the greatest reward and luxury of travel is to be able to experience everyday things as if for the first time, to be in a position in which almost nothing is so familiar it is taken for granted.”

This year, I’ve been fortunate to travel to many places, both near and far, each offering its unique perspective and lessons. I climbed Mount Tai in Taian, attended my sister’s wedding in Linyi, enjoyed breakfast in Tianjin, admired the beauty of West Lake in Hangzhou, and visited the historic Catholic churches in Santiago de Compostela, Spain. These experiences were not just about seeing new sights but about truly living in the moment and cherishing each interaction and memory.

One memorable moment was in Spain, where I tried speaking Spanish with the locals. Sometimes, I succeeded; other times, I faltered and switched to English. Yet, I could see their warmth and encouragement in their eyes, their joy at a foreigner attempting their language. It reminded me that making mistakes is okay—it’s part of learning and growth. There was no “language police,” only kindness and an atmosphere of support. I’m deeply grateful for the freedom to express myself and the generosity of those who encouraged me.

Indeed, there’s so much around us that we often take for granted. But as we know, freedom is not free. The world in 2024 has faced significant conflicts and challenges. Personally, I’ve encountered setbacks like rejected conference papers, job market uncertainties, mass lay-off of the company and even some failed PhD applications. Yet, I believe these obstacles, as painful as they might be, are invaluable lessons that will guide us toward growth and resilience in the future.

Standing at life’s crossroads, unsure of where to go, I’ve learned the value of pausing and trying something new. Why not step off the beaten path and listen to your inner voice? Relying solely on others’ criteria for success limits our potential.  Walking around with a menu in your head of who and what "will work" is like throwing serendipity out the window

As this year comes to a close, let us embrace both the challenges and joys we’ve experienced, for they shape who we are and who we are becoming.

Thank you, and once again, I wish you all a joyful Christmas holiday and a prosperous New Year!
